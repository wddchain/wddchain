# WDD Chain

## About
WDD Chain is a distributed ledger created with Multichain, a modern, secure, permissioned ledger.

WDD Chain is open and free to connect and use. There is an existing backbone of nodes around the world supporting the WDD Chain.

## Obtaining WDD
WDD is not freely obtainable at this point in time.

The WDD Chain supports native assets embedded and secured by the WDD Chain.

Currently Future Vouchers are supported - issued as the native asset "IFV".

## Issuance Details

## Development Resources

   WDD is based on Multichain which is similiar to Bitcoin and other Satoshi clones. Existing Bitcoin developers can readily apply their skills to differentiate themselves in the WDD ecosystem.

   * Beginners to Blockchain technologies should start with [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Cryptocurrencies-ebook/dp/B00QJDYKJO)
   * Bitcoin developers should familiarise themself with the [Multichain API] (http://www.multichain.com/developers/json-rpc-api/) as this is used by the WDD Chain
   * Traders, algos, charting sites, and other financial markets users should start with the [exchange API for WDDEX.COM](http://docs.anxv3.apiary.io/)
